       The First         
           of              
      the Horns

It started in one of    
the sespools of         
wickedness in this      
world. The pillager     
outpost.                   
                            
I was there with my     
love, Jay Silverskull   
the Monster Hunter.    
We had seen the        
structure looming on  
the horizion and gone 
to see what creatures
we could free from    

their cages.              
                            
It didn't take long for 
us to release the lone
iron golem and it        
assisted us in taking   
out the remaing         
pillagers haunting the 
area.                      
                            
Then we looted their   
tower. There wasn't    
much there.  They      
were very succesful  

pillagers.) Except on   
the top floor. I          
opened the singlular   
chest. Inside was some
emeralds, a crossbow, 
and a goat's horn.      
                            
I gave Jay the          
treasures and kept    
the horn. I blew into it 
and it resounded       
across the blocks.     
Crisp and clear, the   
                            

melody Seek played. I  
knew it from the         
pillager raids that I    
have fought.             
                            
It was lovely now tho.  
Like it wasn't being     
played in the minor     
chord.                     
                            
I was immediatly         
enchanted. It was       
clear to me in that     
moment that the one    

of the atroscties of   
the pillagers was that 
they had claimed one  
the only true            
instrument in             
Minecraft and made it  
a war horn.              
                            
Now it became a horn  
of beauty again. I      
used Seek to fill the   
empty air with a call to
explore.                  
                            

Jay and I continued    
on our adventur. We   
were looking for a     
bad lands biome for    
Jay to make his home.  
                            
Often Jay and I would 
get seperated.  I get  
distracted my bees.) I 
could then use Seek   
to help Jay and I find 
eachother again.        
                            
The Sound of the       

horn carries over     
many a block.            
                            
Jay and I completed   
our mission and now    
Seek resides in the    
home we built together
in the land of colorful
soil.                        
                            
I still blow it             
sometimes. It was late  
one night. The stars   
shining above me that  

I last blew it, and Seek
spoke to me.             
                            
''Seek my sisters.''      
                            
There are other        
horns locked in         
pillager chests. Other 
horns still being        
carried by the great  
mountain goats of the 
snowy biomes.            
                            
Others songs waiting   

to be played by a      
creator.                  
                            
It was that moment      
that I knew that I had 
to accept Seek's        
quest.                     
                            
                            
I will find all of her    
sisters.
