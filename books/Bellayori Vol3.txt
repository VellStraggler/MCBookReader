Preface:                  
Unfortunately, the      
original 3rd volume of 
our state's history     
has been lost.           
Hopefully, all            

information found in    
that lost book will be   
found here as well.    
 end of preface)       
                            
 In the time since      
August, quite a few     
momentous occasions  
have occurred. Most   
of them have            
happened in just the  
past week.                
 First, a look at the   
country's richness.    

Just now, we             
surpassed 3 stacks   
of emerald blocks. The
melon machines work   
tirelessly no matter    
what else is going on  
here. Given that we     
have another 9         
stacks of melons, just
selling that will get us 
another 3 stacks of   
emeralds easily. We     
are, however, low on   
diamonds, with 29.       

 Redstone-wise, we    
have found a swamp   
to the Northwest, and  
have connected to it   
with a Rack highway.    
One day, it will be Ice.  
With that swamp, 2       
stacks of slime has    
been gathered, and all
that is left for a TDD  
is finding a coral       
reef.                      
 The Treebrary,       
which has been under 

construction for       
weeks, has finally       
been opened, though it
has about 6% left to   
go. It is among the      
most difficult builds    
I've personally ever   
done. It sits right by   
our first ice race      
track.                     
 In addition, some      
mapping has been       
done, and towers have
been erected in all     

corners but the        
southwest one. Each is
given a color of our   
nation's flag, which we 
must also                 
mass-produce.          
 I'm sure you've        
noticed, but the nation 
has been renamed      
from Bellayu to         
Bellayori, the reason  
being that it sounds    
cooler.                    
                            

  Among the greatest 
of our achievements   
however is our          
mastering of the        
subconscious mind.     
Our scientists put      
substantial effort into
picking apart the       
brain, and seeing how  
one could set it to     
auto-pilot. We've        
successfully created 
the auto-strip-mining  
ability, and auto-       

logging is currently    
underway. We've         
learned how to          
unconsciously           
differentiate between  
wood, leaves, and       
snow. This                
auto-logging will        
happen only in a room 
built specifically with   
that in mind, on          
sub-level 2.              
 The number of        
rooms underground    

now measure as 13,    
with 5 on sub-level 1,  
and 8 on sub-level 2.  
More excavation is     
necessary, which       
provides the need for
our auto-box-mining   
subconscious process
 or ABMSP), which is    
not quite ready but    
can still clear a        
4x10x10 area pretty  
well. No subconscious  
processes account    

for an irregular        
environment, such as  
one with holes, lava,    
mobs, or water.          
Accounting for these  
is miles down our       
research path.          
 Future projects as  
of right now include:   
- Building the SW        
Corner                    
- Mining a stack of     
diamonds                  
- Finding coral          

- Creating a train      
system                    
- Building the TDD      
                            
October 8:                
 I have done it. I       
travelled 20             
kilometers to find and 
bring back coral. It    
was apparently a       
straight shot north,    
but nobody told me.    
Ice covered most of   
the path, which was     

quite disheartening,    
since coral grows      
only in warm waters.   
 After returning with 
the coral, which was a 
VERY perilous trek     
through Hell, I finally  
had all the materials   
for a drill.               
 I tested my first TDD
just west of the       
Treebrary, where now 
sits a 100-meter deep 
hole. Once I learned   

just precisely how     
the machine truly       
worked, I dismantled it 
and set up one in       
sublevel 2  which is    
really 3. There was an
unaccounted-for       
staircase), which        
worked well. But to be 
more useful, I would   
have to turn it into a  
cannon. I set up a      
second TDD, and        
combined they created

a TNT cannon with a    
range of... 6 blocks. I  
tried a 2-TNTP          
cannon, but this         
unfortunately was too 
much for the pistons.  
 Still, I created a      
second hole, roughly  
6 meters wide, going    
down 100 meters        
minimum. My future      
3-TNTP cannon will     
require 4 individual    
TDDs, meaning 24        

blocks of slime, which I
do not have. When this 
is done, I will be able  
to mine out the          
largest man-made      
cavern in existence,   
which will make space  
for our future          
automated endeavors. 
 This has been one    
of the greatest steps 
of Bellayori, right      
next to the Melon       
Farmer 2 and the       

Treebrary.               
 So much progress in 
such short a time. It's 
maddening that I can't 
continue. This feeble   
form can only last a   
few hours at a time    
before my mind gives  
up.                         
 But let us review     
current international  
affairs. Only Moth has 
really gotten on in     
recent times. I believe 

a campaign must be     
led to entice the        
others back into        
existence. I shall       
create a physical map 
to share with            
everyone, inviting them
to visit all the places  
I have discovered. I   
will also keep my trap  
shut about all these   
machines I am making.  
Even from Proto, who  
is afraid of what he    

believes I have         
become.                   
 Something of note is 
that the booming of    
the TDDs travels much
farther than other    
sounds here. Quite     
curious.                   
 I am amazed at how   
quickly these records 
fill up. Nevertheless,   
even if future           
records are longer,   
the most important      

things have already   
happened, and have    
made up for the        
shortness of these    
first volumes.            
 I end this account at
12:25 AM.
