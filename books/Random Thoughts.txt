''What in the F U C K    
is a deductible???''     
                            
Puto pendejo vamos a 
matarte                   
                            
Duuuuuuude I want the
group to take another
trip out to those log   
cabins again. That was 
easily one of the       
greatest times of my   
life. I don't think I was 

                            
I really want to go     
Skiing with the group.  
Well, with some of the  
group.                     
                            
Oh, and the group      
needs to go to          
Universal Studios,      
Orlando Florida one    
day. It's easily my      
favorite place in the   
world. Add in my         
favorite people? Then 

you've got yourself a 
recipe for good times 
and strong memories.  
Though I wonder        
exactly who in the      
group will be too much 
of a PANSY to go on   
the more crazy rides. 
Current guesses: Ink  
will be afraid of the    
higher rides, such as  
Doom's tower of         
terror or The Rock'n  
Roller Coaster.          

I can't imagine           
VellStrag would be too
thrilled about The      
Rock'n either. Oooo I   
woner if I'll be the     
only actual Harry      
Potter fan there. I     
don't think anyon will   
want to buy a wand or 
a cloak besides me.     
But I bought them       
already in 2021.        
Money well spent, says
I.                           

Speaking of travel     
plans. I'm flying to New
Mexico in mid             
February. It'll be my   
first solo flight trip,   
and I'll be gone for a 
little over a week. I'm  
pretty freakin excited 
for it. I wonder if I'll   
bie in a plane crash.   
These words will have 
aged VERY WELL if I    
do.                         
                            

would be terrifying,    
but the adrenaline     
would make it one heck
of a feeling.             
                            
Moving on, I want to    
get The Cheesecake   
Factory's recipe for  
their Pina Coladas.     
They are so GOOD. The
best I've ever had.     
But those bastards    
won't make the recipe  
public. There are only 

speculcations and      
other popular           
recipes. OhhhHHhhhH   
it's a goal for the      
future. I can already  
make some tasty        
frozen drinks, but      
that Pina Colada would 
be my crowning          
acheivment.
