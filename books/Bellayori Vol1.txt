A History of the        
Civilization of Bellayu:  
   Jul. 13 - Jul. 27     
                            
We have claimed land   
200 blocks northwest  
of spawn. David's       
Humble Cottage has    
been erected, and      
sheep and cows, wheat
and pumpkins are       
multiplying. We just got
iron tools, and have a 
stable income of food. 

So far, only Moth has  
seen the land, but      
only Proto knows the  
true plans of this      
soon-to-be great      
nation of Bellayu.       
                            
In worlds past, the     
nations I,                 
VellStraggler, have    
established laid         
shadows over its       
neighbors, and the     
only war ever waged  

was of that against    
loneliness. Some have  
been intimidated by the
majesty and size of   
the architecture and  
wealth of my previous 
lands, so we shall now 
try a different          
approach. No longer   
do we seek any kind    
of attention. We shall  
go underground.        
                            
We shall still have a    

facade of                
unimpressive buildings 
above, but these will   
be to mask what is      
truly happening.        
Additionally, we will no  
longer seek to build a 
wall around our land.  
We will appear poor,    
but this is of course  
to hide the truth.       
                            
It is painful, but we     
shall also reflect this 

plan in how we arm     
ourselves. We will stick
to well-enchanted iron
weapons and armor    
 though our mining      
tools will be as          
powerful as they       
come), and this way, it  
will seem that we        
spend only as much    
time online as anyone  
else. I believe this is   
the key to keeping      
them all around.         

Granted, we cannot     
stay hidden forever. I
am imagining a big       
reveal of                 
simultaneously-explodi
ng TNT, opening a hole
straight into Central   
Square.                   
                            
Naturally, a good       
planning of the layout 
shall be in order. I     
shall design that        
after a little ore-mine.

Okay, today has been  
great. We had Fruit,    
Ink, Frost, Moth, Proto,
Zelgius, and myself all 
online at once, and     
with no lag at all.       
Mining was also          
successful. I have 31 
diamonds. Jack gave   
me 3 as well  bless     
him).                        
                            
                            
                            

It is now July 14, but  
we have not stopped. I
have found an          
entrance to Bellayu    
City, found here:        
                            
-254 y -349             
                            
A sizable, secret,       
explosion-proof room 
has been created.      
Proto is the only one  
privy to it. It is the     
first of its kind.         

Its dimensions are      
roughly 17x18x6,       
minus a corner.         
                            
July 19,                   
We are heading in a    
new direction. Boat     
racing is now a new    
priority  we've even    
begun a resource      
pack for stylization).  
We have reached full  
enchanted diamond     
armor and tools. We    

found a zombie          
spawner not 200        
paces from our         
cottage. Very lucky.    
                            
First villager was       
brought back. Naming  
him Napolean. An        
underground dock     
was created as well. A 
stand-in for a sticky  
piston door is working 
well. You must feed     
the potato to open it.  

We have need of a     
massive melon farm,    
since Napolean          
decided against         
pumpkins.                 
                            
July 23,                   
We now have 2           
villagers, and I bought
the server's first      
mending book at a cool
$36. The melon farm    
runs at 4.5 stacks     
per hour.                 

July 26,                   
The automatic farms   
are too small to be a  
main source. Two        
large farms - one of  
melon, the other of     
sugarcane - have      
been created. Good    
harvests rake in 3/4  
stack of melons and 6 
stacks of sugarcane.  
We now have the best  
sword on the server,  
nicknamed Mr. Monster.

The villager              
population is now 6,    
complete with a          
13-emerald trade for 
mending.                   
                            
   The Great Reset    
   --- July 27 ---    
                            
The Nether was         
opened today. There   
was much joy all        
around as we            
journeyed into          

another world           
together. All of us     
were optimistic.          
                            
That is, until the        
Nether had its way.     
One by one, whether   
by combat or by fire,  
all but 2 of us died,    
and some of us more  
than once. Zel, Moth,   
Jay, Proto, and myself 
all suffered death. In 
mine, I lost all the      

wonderful diamond      
tools and armor that I
possessed. Mr.          
Monster is gone. Two   
books, one titled, ''The 
Search for Zelgius'',   
the other, ''The Book   
of Minecraft             
Knowledge, Volume 1'',  
were lost to the        
embers of that          
unforgiving melted      
rock. I had no chance 
to react. None at all.   

Fortunately, Fruit and 
Ink survived nicely,    
and Ink even found    
netherite. They truly  
were the lucky ones.   
                            
In my misery, I went    
into a dark phase of   
abandon. I resolved   
to leave the             
overworld altogether, 
and survive the         
Nether with nothing     
but my own two feet.   

That lasted much       
longer than I had      
guessed. I had full     
armor of gold,           
leather, and iron, and 
enchantments to boot. 
However, my fault lies 
in a mining accident,    
which plunged me       
straight into the fiery 
depths. A journal was 
lost there too. I am    
beginning to              
understand another   

purpose of my          
existence here. Writing
has become a fine      
pastime of mine, and    
though I have now      
lost 3 books, my         
future library will      
have a dozen at least.
This is not over. I still 
have enough diamonds 
to recreate that        
armor, but I will rely   
on an armorer          
instead. I still need     

tools though.            
                            
In total, there have    
been 9 deaths tonight. 
I am glad I at least     
have gathered          
materials for a          
potions room. Fire      
resistance shall be    
shared with all of      
them. In death, we are 
united, and I hope we  
grow closer in this     
realm.
