Civilization of Bellayu 
#    Aug. 8 - 25    ~   
                            
Much has happened   
since the last page    
regarding Bellayu was 
written. Much indeed. A 
few days prior, I       
created some            
fantastic machines.     
One farms melons at   
an impressive rate,     

filling up a double      
chest in the matter of 
a couple hours  Not   
actually certain what  
the rate is). Then,      
just yesterday, I       
found a bastion in the 
Nether, whose location
is found in the World   
Atlas Vol.1, and within  
it, I discovered 3       
netherite ingots and 3 
scraps. Quite the find. 
I was amazed that I    

didn't even get close  
to death, but I opted   
to instead entrap       
those beastly piglin    
brutes in holes and in 
lava. That way the      
more docile piglins      
would never think ill    
of me.                     
 So, I went and spent 
it all on my armor, and 
I'm simply missing a     
good hat. Again, this    
was just last night.    

 But what happened   
today! That was a       
great achievement. I   
finished the road to   
Zelgius. It is 1200      
blocks in length, and   
goes through 4         
biomes, ending on a     
nether fortress and  
of course Zelgius'      
portal. But now I must 
hide it away, for true  
to form, Zelgius does  
not wish anything less 

than to be a hermit. In 
truth, it is amazing he  
ever told me where he
lived. So, he told me to 
either cover up the    
road or destroy it.     
It's obvious what I      
must do.                   
 In other news, plans 
for a great library    
are being set in place.
Designs are being      
created, a location is  
being thought through,

and I've already        
commissioned Moth to   
write at least another 
book for me  she       
sounded like she was  
going to write 2 or 3). 
Proto also wants to    
contribute, but          
decided he can't copy 
his book from the last 
world because it is     
too personal. I          
wonder if he will still   
try writing something.  

 Update, he will. I also
created a map of       
base points, and        
discovered that Inky  
travelled just as far 
as Zelgius did to get   
to her current          
location. I realize I     
must make a road to   
her as well, and         
naturally it will branch
off of Hermit Highway. 
 Update, the main       
melon machine cranks  

out 96 melons/hr. The 
alternate machine      
seems to do about 1/3
that, but still unsure.  
Theoretically, that's    
120 melons/hr. Our    
economy is very much 
gourd-based  yes I    
looked it up, melons    
are considered         
gourds). We welcomed  
a new villager who      
trades both melons    
and pumpkins as well.  

Aug. 24:                   
I have returned from 
a quest for netherite. 
It was mostly in vain,   
but a complete set of  
armor has now been   
created. Plans for the
Treebrary are being  
set in motion.             
                            
They say to run        
towards your fears. I 
fear the Treebrary.   
                            

Aug. 25:                   
Today we were          
attacked by a hoarde 
of pillagers. There     
was a warlock, flying   
demons, several large 
beasts, and many       
powerful axemen, but  
all are dead now. Our  
defenses are secure. 
                            
Our manual sugarcane
farm boasts 12 stacks
and 24 canes in a      

single harvest.          
                            
Also, the base of The  
Treebrary is            
complete. It is quite    
organic, and the        
diameter of the tree   
is 8 meters. It is still   
only the third-most    
difficult part of         
construction, as the   
branches and leafing  
are next.                 
                            

Given the fact that     
our farms are quite   
large and most are on
the surface and on    
account of how we     
simply can't keep our  
mouths shut, Bellayu is
going to switch focus  
a little bit. All of our   
sneaky money           
machines shall remain  
below the surface, but
we are going to make  
our presence on the  

surface more known.   
The Treebrary was an
unconscious step in    
this direction.            
Additionally, we've       
noticed that the lack   
of beauty we've shown
has not changed        
anything regarding     
the presence of        
other people. Proto    
still works as often as
ever, and so does      
Moth  these are the    

most common people to
be found working at    
all, three times as      
common as anyone      
else).                      
                            
OTHER thing. A beehive 
near Moth's residence 
was accidentally        
destroyed  I wanted   
to find bees), and now 
we have a new mission 
to get the hive back   
to her.                    

We later found a        
beehive near Twin      
Peak bay. It is already
flourishing, and we will 
replace Moth's hive    
without a problem.      
                            
It has been              
discovered that we will
need a flower farm    
for dyes. Bellayu is    
running through        
banner designs.         
                            

We reached a            
wonderful benchmark  
of 2 stacks of          
emerald blocks  or 18 
stacks of emeralds).   
Some amythest was     
gathered from Zel's    
mine, which is quite      
vast but not at all      
maze-like. We may       
start creating           
advertisements to sell 
things like railways     
 which we have an      

infinite amount of       
thanks to our Rail      
Machine). Honey blocks
will be arriving soon,   
meaning we need        
corral. A sizeable      
amount of TDD  TNT    
Duplication Drilling) is  
in order. A book on    
how to make such a    
machine is also in       
order, though I don't  
know if it is functional 
like in the old days.    

Before closing for     
the day, I would like to
add that an item chute 
would be very nice.    
Perhaps we'll make a   
wishing well.              
                            
We are almost there.   
Once the bees are     
producing honey at an
acceptable rate, many 
machines are opened  
up. The TDD is           
necessary to expand  

the hidden part of     
Bellayu, for we won't   
dare spend a minute   
longer mining than we  
need to.                   
I do wish people were 
on more, but all we     
can do is hope that    
our obvious love of    
the game will bring      
them in.
