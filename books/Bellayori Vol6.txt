This book has been    
written four times.      
Four. It is unknown     
what happened to the  
other three books.     
                            
I shall try to touch on
everything that's       
happened. I will          
probably miss many    
things.                     
                            
To start, let's look at  
a summary. We've        

already had the best  
tools and armor for a 
long time. Since the     
inception of this world,
Bellayori has not       
strayed far from the  
bounds it set, but       
we've built much more  
above, and we've        
digged far more below.
                            
I struggle even to     
remember the order in
which all creations     

were built, so let us    
review what was         
already in existence.  
                            
The Treebrary, the    
tree farm, the Wedding
Church, Emerlin House 
 recently named), the  
bamboo farm, the       
sugarcane farm, the   
automatic melon,         
pumpkin, carpet/rail,   
cactus, and cobble-   
stone farms,             

sublevels 0 through   
3, the railway to the   
Treebrary, The         
Doghouse, The Dot      
House, the corner      
markers, the castle on
the hill, the ice          
raceway, an area for 
turtles, and a           
stairwell that goes     
down 70 blocks. At the 
bottom of it is found a 
tunnel that is still 100 
blocks in length.        

Many other pieces of  
construction have      
happened since.         
                            
One of the greatest   
among them is not       
even within our          
borders. It was         
requested by none     
other than Prototype  
himself. Its name        
escapes me  because  
I don't think it makes   
any sense), but it is a 

tower of great          
proportions, rivalling  
even the size and      
height of the great    
Castle of Veloria.       
                            
This tower has a        
diameter of 48 meters 
at the base and 20     
meters at its tip. It     
has a height of 105    
meters. It is made only
of deepslate and       
black glass. It is still  

waiting for Proto to    
move in and design the
interior, as was his     
task. The last time I    
tried giving him an      
interior, he removed it 
all  punk).                
                            
This structure is       
found at -565 -165.   
The materials needed  
for it were gathered  
using a semi-automatic 
tunnel-boring machine.

This machine was made 
of a number of things, 
chiefest among them   
being a netherite       
debris tip. The           
materials gathered     
from the tunnel this    
machine made filled 5  
double chests. The     
tunnel itself, now the  
longest wide, manmade 
tunnel on the planet,   
measures 385 meters. 
Yes, a lot was left      

over. The actual        
construction took a    
mere couple of days.  
The base took over    
half the time to          
create. I'm also still    
waiting on Proto to     
remodel the hooks at  
the top of it.             
                            
Back at home, a need  
for xp brought the    
idea of a mob farm,     
which was installed in  

sublevel 2 by the       
stairwell. It did not do 
very well, so we went  
and lit up every cave 
nearby with torches.   
It still does not do     
well.                        
                            
We also made a slime   
farm in the               
marshlands, which is   
covered in mushrooms.
It also does not do    
well.                        

We also made a gold    
farm hundreds of      
blocks north of the    
shore. It also has not 
done very well.          
                            
We also made a          
smallest-scale map of 
central Zamdaskin.      
Bellayori is found in   
the very bottom-right 
corner.                   
                            
A couple important     

moments have also     
occurred. There was  
the Burrowed            
Slaughter, which killed 
our best and            
brightest villagers,     
cutting our population 
in half. Security         
measures have since  
been put in place.      
                            
There was also a       
great expedition which 
took place in the        

Nether. The party      
consisted of myself,   
Proto, Moth, and Jay.   
Casualties were         
relentlessly high.       
Even I died once.       
Proto luckily survived.
We have since           
installed a kill           
counter. I am now at 9.
Moth, last I checked,   
was at 35.                
                            
We did find many        

bastions and a couple 
of fortresses as well. 
I would be surprised  
weeks later to find a  
zombie pigman wearing 
Moth's armor.            
                            
Something wonderful   
that happened was     
that we finally went to 
kill the Ender dragon. 
It is written in more    
detail in the book ''The 
Dragon's Death''.        

After that, I             
straightaway left to    
get my very own        
elytra, which I now     
wear everywhere I go.
Them's called            
Flipfloops. For once, I 
did NOT die in the End, 
for which I am           
grateful.                  
                            
There's also been a   
lot of remodelling. The 
entrance to the         

Underground is much  
nicer. A central         
square with a spring   
and official flag has   
been built as well, and 
pathways have been   
created going to        
nearly every building  
in town.                    
                            
A great museum         
overlooks Bellayori on
the peak of Mount      
Chartiectus. It is made 

of fine quartz,          
deepslate, and gold. It 
holds statues of the   
Ender dragon, the      
Wither, and a map of   
Bellayori, and the       
armor of Moth, which   
was found on the       
body of a walking       
pigman corpse. More   
installations to come.   
                            
An island supported   
by copper beams has  

been placed by our    
shore, and upon it a   
guest house built by   
Moth for Moth.           
                            
Once I got an elytra, I
wanted to make          
Bellayori more           
flight-friendly, so the 
underground has       
been opened up         
somewhat. There are   
now 4 holes you can   
fly into to get inside.   

The largest resides   
just above the great  
stairwell. The first two
are above our main    
lobby, which has been 
cleaned up profusely. 
All ways out of the     
lobby are now via      
redstone doors, all of
which, when closed,     
blend in perfectly with
the walls.                 
                            
The ice roads of the  

Nether have been      
finished as well,         
complete with buttons  
to prevent rogue       
spawning, and ceilings 
and walls. From          
Bellayori, you can get 
to the World Hub,       
Moth's house, Proto's  
house, Zelgius's house
 though the entrance  
is hard to find), the    
End dungeon,            
Marshlands, and our   

latest addition,          
Badlands, whose        
coordinates were       
purchased from Moth. 
An intricate tunnel     
system was made        
there as a way to      
prevent boredom when
mining for clay.          
                            
The farmhouse on the 
northwest corner is   
still in use, though our
primary food source  

has been golden        
carrots from the       
villagers. Emerald      
production has slowed
considerably, as it is  
no longer a priority,   
but we are up to 6     
stacks of blocks of    
emeralds now. We also 
have 3 stacks of iron 
and gold apiece, lots   
of freshly made        
netherrack for some  
future construction,   

and loads and loads   
of stone.                 
                            
The burnboo farm      
made to smelt the       
stone is not effective 
at all, but with the      
pipes I installed, you   
can send burnable     
materials from the      
lobby 3 floors up.      
Just a week ago, we    
had such an             
abundance that I       

decided to make a      
useless but              
good-looking building  
near the farmhouse.   
It is aptly named the   
Needle Stand, as it     
appears to be a        
leaning tower holding  
up a large needle. It   
has been filled with    
openings for            
recreational use by   
elytra pilots such as  
myself. It's quite fun   

to walk in too. It is in   
fact the same exact   
height as Proto's       
tower from its base.   
Please don't tell him.   
                            
Now we're finally        
catching up to what's  
happened recently.    
More support was      
added to the ice        
raceway, and the       
treebrary has been   
covered on top with    

green clay. Sublevel 2
was given a makeover, 
and a secret Orange  
Room has been put in  
place. If you find it,    
record the code        
found within it, as this 
may become useful in  
the future.               
                            
The mob farm is now   
automatic, as there is  
a fine XP farm in the   
End. We have a need   

for gunpowder all the 
time, because I just    
love flying so dang    
much.                      
                            
There is also now a    
large, mysterious face
carved into the side   
of our one cliff to the
southwest. It's quite    
ugly.                       
                            
Many trees have been 
planted all over the   

surface. A               
campground has even 
been created atop the
mob farm. It is quite    
cozy. Finally, among all
that I can remember,   
the latest thing I've    
built is a large sign    
with the name of our   
quaint nation written   
on both sides. It        
towers over all the    
nearby surface        
buildings, which brings 

me to the things I wish 
to build one day.        
                            
The only useful item in
that list is the Iron    
Farm, which I am still   
afraid to make.          
                            
I also wish to build a   
slight skyscraper, but 
I will need something   
to fill it with, some      
machine that requires 
lots of vertical space.

I wish to perhaps       
build 3 more spike-like 
towers for the          
remaining three         
corners of Bellayori.  
I believe it would look  
quite cool.                
                            
One other intimidating  
build idea is that of    
the floating glass      
castle which I wish to  
build in the sky. I have
yet to come up with     

any designs, and have 
no clue how large it    
will be, or what          
materials will line the   
corners besides        
glass. I want this to    
be beautiful, but        
realize I probably      
shouldn't put it dead   
center above            
Bellayori. Maybe I'll     
put it above a spot     
near the big sign.       
                            

I also want to create  
a powerline made of    
string, a design which  
was researched        
awhile ago that would  
make good use of all   
that excess string at  
Proto's spider farm.   
The trouble is what its
use would be.            
                            
I also wish to build a   
digital clock of some   
kind. And then there's 

the idea of putting up 
beacons  not literal    
ones) that designate   
when a farm is ready  
for harvest.             
                            
I still want to make the
Doghouse bigger and  
nicer inside. I also     
want to cover my       
tools in netherite. If   
Bellayori is to grow    
further than it          
already is, it will of     

course only grow      
upwards or              
downwards. Our initial  
efforts to not look     
intimidating had no      
effect at all, and only 
the four people         
mentioned in this book 
ever get on at all.      
Well, with the slight     
exception of Dot, who  
to my happy surprise  
decided to read every
single published book  

in the Treebrary. I     
have no clue when     
else she gets on, but  
it's lovely to have      
readers.                  
                            
Speaking of which, this 
will be the 19th          
published book. Moth   
has another couple    
on the way, and also   
she and Proto           
recently submitted a   
book apiece, which I    

reviewed and enjoyed 
just today.               
                            
It's embarrassing to   
say, but the              
Treebrary is still not  
completed on the       
inside. I wish also to   
add some windows. A    
couple will be put       
through the leaves,    
and one will go          
through the trunk.     
This is all for the      

benefit of our flyers. 
                            
This server has been 
alive for 8 months      
now. That is not as     
long as Wellscraft      
lasted  at 14 months   
or so), but I believe it 
is the longest our      
friend group has had 
one. I wish I wish so    
much that Inky and     
Fruit and Zelgius       
would get on again.     

At the end of the day, 
this server is really   
just occupied by Moth 
and I, with a few        
occasional visitors. I  
wish that were           
different, but no one  
enjoys it as much      
anymore.                  
                            
I've thought about      
asking Moth if we        
could get other         
people online, but I     

refrained. We may not 
have many who get on, 
but this is just for    
us. It is special. And   
thanks to our efforts,
it is alive with history, 
a bit of lore, and       
creation. I'm going to   
invite everyone to      
move in nearby as      
neighbors to Bellayori,
and then ask if I can  
build stuff for their   
places. I'm going to     

give everyone copies  
of the map of central 
Zamdaskin, and put     
them all on it. As the   
months go on, and      
real life continues, I   
want to have larger   
builds happen, larger  
even than Proto's      
tower or the             
Treebrary or the      
museum. I have Moth's  
promise that this        
server will last a       

long, long time.           
                            
To you, dear reader, I
thank you for giving   
this book a look. This  
will be the last          
installation of The      
History of Bellayori. It
is also now the          
longest book on         
record. And this time,  
we're not going to      
lose it. Thank you for 
visiting the Treebrary.
