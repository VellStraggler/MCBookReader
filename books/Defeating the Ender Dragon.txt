'---------------'    
                            
On March the 4th, 5    
intrepid adventurers  
set forth to slay he   
who guarded the End.  
There was Frost, a     
younger lad who had  
much to learn, Vell,     

who could meticulously
plan out anything only 
for it to fail, Proto,    
the drug supplier, Dot,
sister to Moth, and     
Moth, the leader of     
the pack.                 
                            
All had enchanted      
diamond armor. All had 
potions of every kind. 
As for myself, Slow     
Falling was the clear  
favorite. At 8:15 pm,    

we took photos, and at
8:16, the last eye of   
the portal was placed 
by none other than    
Vell, and one by one,   
the crew dived in.       
                            
Tragedy struck         
immediately. Through a 
small amount of         
carelessness, all but  
Proto and Vell fell     
from the portals        
destination platform.   

Many a great armor    
piece and weapon was 
lost to the void.         
                            
But Proto and Vell      
moved on. They built a 
bridge to the main      
island, and began       
mining into it when all   
of the sudden the      
dragon fired its        
horrid breath at them, 
which had a stench so 
vile that a few short   

breaths of it would kill
you.                        
                            
They quickly built       
over it and landed on 
the island. The plan    
went immediately into   
action, and the towers 
of the dragon were    
laid under siege. One  
by one, each of the    
magic orbs atop the    
towers were             
destroyed.               

The Slow Falling         
effect was but an      
inkling of what it would 
be like to fly with an   
elytra, and this was    
Vell's real goal.         
Meanwhile, during the  
battle, he floated from
tower to tower, until   
finally, he'd taken out  
the last orb, and then 
the dragon had no     
more regenerative     
abilities.                   

In this particular       
fight, everyone's aim   
was rather poor. I     
suppose we were out  
of practice. Moth       
decided mainly to just 
watch the show, as     
she was still lamenting 
the loss of her best   
gear.                      
                            
The dragon perched   
perhaps 3 times,        
steadily losing health  

with every swing of    
every sword and       
every shot of every  
arrow  that didn't       
miss). Before long, and
it wasn't very long,     
the dragon was on its 
last legs. It was Proto 
who fired the last      
arrow, that final shot  
which killed the beast. 
                            
And up it went in a      
flash of purple 20     

meters from the        
ground, where it        
imploded and burst     
into a hundred          
experience orbs.       
Proto collected most   
of them, and rightfully 
so. Vell already had   
69 levels going in, and 
Proto had more than   
clearly pulled his       
weight.                     
                            
                            

With the dragon gone,  
the egg was swiftly     
collected, and Vell was
swiftly off to find the 
true prize.               
                            
The next few hours    
were spent searching 
for End cities, of       
which I believe 4 were 
found. Vell found 2     
elytras and got lost,   
and in the end, there  
were only about 6      

casualties.               
                            
Now, for my personal  
account, I,                
VellStraggler, also     
defeated many          
shulkers, and            
gathered much armor  
from their                
strongholds. I am       
presently updating     
Bellayori to be more   
flier-friendly, with      
gaping holes in the     

ceilings planned in all  
major rooms of the    
Underground. Today,   
one was added above  
the Great Staircase    
 you'll know it when     
you see it), in which    
floor access begins   
on Sublevel 2.           
                            
I cannot wait for us   
to defeat the Wither.   
Once he too is dead,   
of course it shall be  

recorded and stored  
in the great              
Treebrary, where you 
perhaps found this    
book as well.             
                            
       The  End
