 A momentous           
achievement has...       
been achieved. Where  
once, we had glitches  
in our                     
self-programming       
trials, now we have     
made leaps and         
bounds. Mining no       
longer changes your  
direction, and now      
players can reliably   
turn left or right as   
well as look up or      

down. Using this new    
technology, automatic  
tree-felling will         
become a reality.       
 Additionally, we've     
learned to type         
automatically, and       
even speak. We are on
the verge of            
greatness!               
 We just need a little 
more time, and a little  
more sleep.              
                            

November 26,            
 The subconscious    
tree-chopping trials   
have been a great     
success. Yes, there    
are a few bugs in      
need of fixing, such    
as trees growing       
through the player    
and blocks breaking   
that weren't supposed 
to be broken. With this 
success, we are        
actually going to move 

on to more building     
additions.                 
 The one that we       
added all in one day is
Wedding Church, built  
just behind the Melon 
House. It has been     
dedicated to two of my
good friends, who got 
married in real life     
today. If you were     
there, I'm sure you     
remember the many     
happy moments that    

went on throughout    
the day. I played as   
the pianist during the  
wedding, and both he   
and she seemed to be 
holding back just how 
happy they felt. I'm     
SURE they're having a 
good time right now as 
well...                       
                            
 Anyways, the           
Underground is still in 
need of expansion; a  

little bit of personality
. Below are the rooms 
necessary to be        
added:                     
- Mob Farm              
- Duel Room             
- Trophy Room         
- Marketplace          
 I also want to make a
gold farm in the         
Nether, though some   
research is required  
before making           
anything effective.     

 Oh, also an iron       
farm. My goodness, in  
all my life, I've never  
been able to make a    
successful one. Plus  
there's the whole       
ethics of boxing in     
some poor villagers to
mamke the thing work.  
It's a toughy.            
                            
 After a hard day of 
lazy mining, a double   
chest has been filled  

with deepslate. A good 
ally of Bellayori is in  
need of 100 stacks,    
and we are already a 
third there. On the     
side, we found 69       
diamonds on accident.  
Nice.                       
                            
Dec. 14,                   
 A great and lengthy 
journey happened     
just last night. The    
troupe of adventur-  

ers consisted of Moth,
Proto, Jay, and me.     
Our goal? Find a        
bastion in hell.           
 If you want to know  
the results, they come
in two parts. In part   
one, we found many    
nether fortresses     
whilst travelling         
south-by-southwest   
off Ralliaxis  The       
Nether world Hub).     
During this half of the

journey, Jay died at   
least a dozen times,    
seemingly enjoying     
death and its inability  
to stop him. He sought 
the blood of pigs, and 
I sought to stop him    
for a time. Never have
I seen anyone so       
eager to convince me  
of their lack of skill.   
It still baffles me.      
 Moth unfortunately   
also fell prey to        

death, and it all         
turned out for the     
worse when she took  
a stumble into an       
ocean of lava. There,  
she lost all of her     
items, and group        
morale hit a horrible   
low. At least, except    
for me, who found all  
of this quite amusing.  
 Proto was              
professional, as        
always, and ne'er lost 

his life. Even I took a  
fall, dropping over a  
hundred blocks whilst 
speed-building a        
bridge. After all the   
dozens of monsters   
and pools of lava I    
endured, I fell prey   
to the floor. Pity me.   
 Anyways, part one    
conluded with Jay and 
Moth quitting. It was   
too much to bear,       
having a net loss.      

Me and Proto            
continued, as Moth      
also happens to be a  
sorceress, and         
teleported easily back
to her home.             
 We had 3000 blocks  
to cover, made          
exceedingly longer by 
the treacherous        
terrain of hell, but it  
was well worth the      
distance. In part one,  
we discovered two      

bastions, but on the    
way back, Proto and I 
found four. I am        
already fully decked  
out in netherite, so     
with what little we       
found, I forged an     
ingot and built a gift   
altar for him in his     
yard. We also found    
37 gold blocks, some   
diamond armor, and     
lots of gilded            
blackstone for Moth,   

ever the architect.     
Even most of my loot   
consisted of building   
materials.                 
 Most likely, Proto will 
return the gold that I 
shared with him, as I   
told him I wish to build 
a golden castle. This   
dream is as far away  
as it was a month ago, 
and until I begin on it, 
there it shall remain.   
 Today, we hit a new   

record in trading. in a 
mere 3 minutes, the     
villagers brought to   
pass 22 emerald        
blocks. The golden     
castle should            
probably be partially  
green as well, and I    
don't think this will be  
any less impressive.   
                            
December 20,            
 The past few days   
have been the most    

productive of all. The 
Automatic Cobblestone 
Machine was built, and 
makes cobblestone     
faster than 2 people  
could mine it. A          
stone-making kiln was  
added, and a bamboo   
farm for firewood was
added also. It is all    
automatic, but you can 
send more firewood    
from the main room.    
 A slime farm has      

been constructed and 
nearly complete, but is
missing stacks of       
mushrooms for the     
floors. A gold and xp  
farm will be built in the
nether, and an iron    
farm here in Bellayori.
We passed 5 emerald  
stacks, and are         
working on rooms for  
a mushroom farm and  
a stasis chamber.       
           END
