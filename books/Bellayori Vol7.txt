    -- Volume 7 --     
                            
The times, they are     
changing. This world   
of ours has taken a   
backseat to the one   
we don't get a break   
from.                      
But while I am here, I  
wish only to create    
beauty.                    
In here, I shall lay     
out my plans for        
Bellayori.                 

I picture a great orb  
in the center, akin to  
the Seattle Space      
Needle but only         
barely. It has an       
elevator going up      
alongside a redstone  
wire. Using binary, this 
wire will be able to     
activate all kinds of    
contraptions.            
In the orb, you will be 
able to see              
everything Bellayori   

has to offer. I want    
an attractive            
sugarcane               
skyscraper. I want a  
very visible iron farm, 
where each golem is   
see dropping from a   
great height. I want a  
clock built into the     
mountainside. I want 20
houses added here    
and there, and some   
with purpose.            
                            

I want infrastructure. 
I want highways and    
waterways, like          
aquaducts and          
sewers. I want a good 
old item collection      
pipeline, like what I     
had in Veloria. I want  
music playing! I want   
multiple levels of town 
supported on columns 
and beams. I want an   
artificial sun! I want    
rings to fly through!   

Is it possible? Can I   
really gain all of this?
It's times like these     
when I wish I wasn't    
alone.                     
Zamdaskin has really  
dropped off as of     
late. I think my farms  
may have had            
something to do with it, 
but if so, all they did  
was hasten the          
inevitable.                
                            

People come and go.   
That's how it is. In the 
end, this is all just an 
old dream.                
                            
Maybe that's something
I can manifest in my    
building. A dream.
