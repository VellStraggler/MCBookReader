{{________________.}}
Vol.IV: Oct.23 - Nov.14 
                            
 These days are all   
about COSMETICS! Yes, 
Bellayori is               
resourceful, and       
careful, and humbly    
extensive, but in some 
areas, it is downright  
ugly. So! today we      

fixed up Sublevel 0 to 
be more presentable.  
We created a nice      
suite in Sublevel 3      
just a couple days    
ago as well.              
 Above the surface,  
cobblestone roads     
have been paved, and 
the tree farm is        
partially enclosed.     
More buildings will be  
added, though I         
struggle to imagine     

what use they'll have.  
Perhaps there will be  
simple stores, like one 
for wood, one for      
food, etc. A              
Surface-level town    
plan should be in       
order.                     
 Given the sheer       
amount of mining that  
will have to take place,
a permanent             
auto-stone machine is 
unnecessary. The      

hole we drilled          
starting at Sublevel 2 
will be the only time    
such a machine will     
ever be needed here. 
 Yes, in the              
civilizations of our     
ancestors on worlds  
unknown, we know that 
beauty was important,  
but overlooked in       
areas between such   
places as underwater 
cities, canyons, and    

Main Street. We seek   
to fill in this land, and 
bring it to life. We are 
not strung out too     
thin, as they say the   
ancient nation was.     
The land claimed is     
plenty manageable.     
 Something we will      
need much of is glass. 
Sublevel 1 will get an  
extension visible        
underwater, which      
means windows of all   

shapes and sizes.      
 It's worth noting that
wood will always be     
needed, so perhaps    
an auto-wood            
contraption using a    
TDD will be needed      
after all.                 
                            
October 29:              
 Today we built a      
crimson building         
around our bamboo    
farm. There is           

research being done  
on the applications of 
bamboo, and it feels    
right to give it more    
meaning. Additionally,   
we've learned a         
redstone technique    
that delays power      
loss. We implimented it  
on the front door,     
which now stays open  
for a good 2 seconds.
 A few days ago, we   
created a picturesque

Autumn scene with two 
brick houses and       
leaves all around.      
 Presently, there are
now 8 Surface          
buildings, and oh! We   
also added a            
staircase to the huge 
underground hole we  
made. More detail work 
will be added later. An 
area still needs to be 
cleared for the         
Auto-Log machine.      

November 3:              
 Much studying has    
been done on the AWF 
 Auto-Wood Farm).      
Numbers have been    
crunched by our       
foremost scientist,     
myself, and we've       
learned that such a   
machine is possible.    
Whether it's worth the 
trouble is still in the   
air. The larger Melon  
Farm has been          

converted to a          
bonemeal machine for  
the time being.           
 Today, we passed 4  
stacks of emerald      
blocks, or 2,240         
emeralds. I have a     
feeling we won't be     
needing that much      
melon for money        
anymore.                  
                            
November 14,            
 A lot of redecorat-  

ing has happened       
recently. Sublevel 0   
has seen the most of  
it, with a new piston     
door put in to keep    
our villagers safe, a  
little piston addition to 
our enchantment area,
and an enlargement of
our staircase into      
Sublevel 1.               
 Also, the cows and   
sheep have been       
moved to the north-   

west corner as         
planned.                  
 The entrance has    
been remodeled, and   
now a staircase does  
not go down in front   
of it. It looks so much 
better.                    
 I cured a villager    
earlier, but then        
forgot about him. I     
wonder which house    
he's in  if he's alive).   
 But the biggest thing 

to have happened, and
one that shall be       
written into legend,     
was the discovery of  
the first Deep Dark    
City, AND meeting a      
demon of an unknown  
realm, the Warden.      
 Moth was the one     
who found the place   
beneath our new        
World Hub, which she   
has also been           
developing. She won    

a bet with me about     
that, and now I'm down 
20 gold blocks. I'm not 
even mad.                 
 All kinds of loot are 
down there. And all     
kinds of terrifying     
danger. If the legends
are true, it can kill     
you with sound alone,  
and through walls. The
only wall that dampens
the attacks are wool,  
which we will be mass- 

producing eventually  
in an auto-farm. We    
have a lot of            
projects to do, you    
see.                        
 The other day, I      
also helped Moth mine  
some prismarine from  
a water temple, and    
she rewarded me with  
a swimming                
enchantment and an    
infinite arrow            
enchantment.             

 Bellayori, in short, is 
on the cusp of many   
great advancements,   
but for now, this place
is downright ugly in    
some spots and needs 
a face lift.               
 It should be noted   
that on a whim, I         
vandalized Moth's       
house with an entire   
stack of emerald       
blocks. She is our      
greatest ally, and I    

am enjoying chaotic    
philanthropy.            
 Something else: we    
had a record four     
people online today.    
Given that those with   
knowledge of this       
world is in the the      
single digits, that's no 
small thing. I am         
unsure of the highest 
recorded number of   
people, but it can't be 
more than 5.             

 A moderate amount   
of digging occurred   
on our bottom floor,   
which will eventually    
be Sublevel 12.          
Entrances to each     
Sublevel will be at      
each corner of our   
200ft. drop staircase, 
which probably needs 
a cool name. It occurs
to me that a diagram   
of the future of        
Bellayori Underground

needs to be drawn up, 
and perhaps even in a
book like this. I'm sure 
this would be helpful   
to those visiting our   
halls.                      
 There is so much     
work to be done. I      
wish I could recruit    
someone else, but we  
all want something to   
call our own. It's        
always been this way.  
           END
