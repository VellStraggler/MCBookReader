Knots and Sawdust:
Chapters 1 through 3
By: David Wells

Chapter 1:

	Subtlety is everything. Color, I think, would detract, so no color. I’m no good with the theory of it anyhow. Beginning just off-center, I prepare what would at first glance be a meaningless arrangement of circles. There I’ll put my silhouette. Everything behind me shall be blindingly bright, like the light from my window, and everything in front will be cloaked in darkness. Contrast makes up for the lack of color, but not the potential lack of focus. I think I will dabble in reds on the silhouette after all. And above me, yes, there belongs the ones who started it all. I draw faint outlines, as I can only work on one piece of a work at a time.
	At my feet, that’s where those many shining gifts will lay. Those numerous, disgusting, greedy gifts. I almost wish I could paint it instead, but paint is too expensive. But pens and pencils will never be. This one will be called “The Waste”. I’m so creative, aren’t I. That’s the point though. I’m still trying to settle that argument; whether I’m worth what I think I am. It is only in fairness that I must bring evidence to both sides.
	The nice thing about being subtle with this piece is that I don’t have to be good at making it. Nothing is supposed to quite look like anything. In theory, this means I could increase how much art I make, because if I can’t even tell how bad it is, maybe I’ll let myself do it again. It’s no wonder to me then that this world is home to so many abstract artists.
	I continue with impressions of walls, a little wallpaper here, a crowning there. The whole idea is that you can’t make much of anything. I’m not here to make sense to anyone, after all. Just myself.
Right as I begin more solid linework, my phone buzzes, giving my current line a slight jostle. Who knew this desk was so rickety, like a thin, old greyhound. I’m glad I wasn’t on to pen marking yet. I twist my pencil about, ready to erase and amazed at how unannoyed I am to do so, but then stop. I think it will look better this way, the whole art piece too. Who was it that unknowingly aided my work?
	I flip my phone over. Marriot needs a ride, she says. Her new boy’s car won’t start. Already, I’ve reached for the keys from off my bed. It’s her, after all. I eye my socks in the corner, which I hate wearing without shoes. I’ve driven without shoes before, but I wouldn’t recommend it.
	It’d be funny if my car didn’t start either, but I got its annual check-up done just last week. I doubt Ridley’s ever gotten one for what he drives. Marriot’s told me already of the odd noises it’s made just since last month, and he’s probably too afraid of what the noises mean. That’s me being judgmental though. It’s things like that that explain why I used to be so quiet. It’s how I discovered how to get good at talking to people. It’s got one rule and a specification, and they’re very simple.
Tell them what they want to hear.
Note the rare occasion when they actually want your opinion.
Why did it take me so long to figure that out? Well, it doesn’t really matter anymore.
Lo and behold, the car starts, so I then pull out of our drab little driveway. I never liked gravel on concrete. I proceed to drive at 25 past dozens of other carbon-copies of both our driveway and our house. I never liked suburban areas either, but particularly those that are in cookie-cutter fashion. Particularly where I live. Naturally, the only place to look that is easy on the eyes is up. At least the sky is pretty, with magnificent, royal clouds creating a perimeter around our overtly American town. I realize that this is the first time I’ve even looked at the sky today. I’ll be sure not to thank Marriot for that, because what an odd thing to say.
Pearl Street, Terrace Street, the Boulevard… I’m surprised at the lack of cars, or at least the ones with people in them. In theory, if she’s getting off work, then there’s a thousand others doing the same thing nearby. Maybe this is yet another moment of my luck deciding to show its flaky face. Or maybe I never bothered to check the time.
	Down I go through West Boulevard, past my mom’s favorite gas station, past a McDonald’s I applied to even though they weren’t hiring, and past the terribly expensive, local grocery store called Jimmy’s. I applied there too, but even a phone call and return visit hasn’t graced me with a response. It’s an odd thing that there’s no East Boulevard, or even a North or South one. I suppose the town planners had bigger aspirations than could ever come true, just like me.
It’s nice that this road only curves occasionally. Despite lying about how much driving time I had to get my license, I don’t even need to think about it anymore. I’m used to the size of this car, and the tuning of the wheel, how it turns with the slightest nudge at the lowest of speeds. I’ve learned to manage just one steady hand on it, and I rarely forget to look further ahead in order to keep my turns smooth.
	Rarely, I say. It wouldn’t be a lie if it meant “almost always”. Still, I’d say I’ve done very well with the nine hours of practice I’ve ever had. Given more, I could be great. If only there were a smidgeon of demand for it, I could even excel.
I say that about a lot of things. I could be known by now if only I’d taken theater last year. I could be the artist of a hit single found on all the “What’s New” playlists out there. I could at least be teaching guitar, or fleshing out that comic I keep saying I could do if I just found the time. I’m good at a lot of things, as I’ve seen in virtually all of my classes as well. Geography is just memorization. English is just candidness and the right big words. Math is logic. Especially in programming, where there’s a clear difference between those who can do it and those who can copy, I do well. It’s my one class I enjoy, and only because I like the feeling of being the best in the room. That feeling only sticks around for so long these days. If only I actually enjoyed anything else besides feeding my ego, I might actually be getting good grades again. Because all the other classes require what I have apparent little reserve of: effort.
	Why don’t I have that? Why has it become so difficult? Well, I don’t know. I want more, but the days go by too quickly. I’m somehow always in a rush, and yet my assignments are always late, my room’s always a mess, I don’t even have a job, and my skill as a driver is, at best, amateur.
	 Finally, I’m met with other vehicles at the very intersection I have to turn on. Oh, the joy. Marriot’s probably going to want something to eat. I do like making sure she’s taken care of, but once again I’ve forgotten. I told you I don’t think. I’m mindless and useless. I could do so much better if only…
	I see her waiting outside Denny’s. She waves at me. Thank goodness for tintless windows. I pull in next to her and reach for her door. She swings it open, making me look like the same idiot I’ve always been, so I need to have a reason for my hand being there. I wave at her again. Why. Just why.
	“Hey, Ant,” she says, only barely put off.
	“Hey Marriot. Buckle up.” Wait, who says that? She goes by Mary anyways, or at least prefers it. I try again. She’s used to this.
	“How was work?” Sounds forced. But she’s used to this.
	She responds,” It was good. Got lots of tips--”
	“Pshh, not as much as me. Not if you include the 300 self-help tips I read every day, that is.”
	This, she laughs at. I don’t know why. It wasn’t funny, and I interrupted her, and it wasn’t funny. Just why. Have you ever wanted to tell someone that they’re wrong for thinking you weren’t idiotic or lame? Not me.
	She looks away and begins speaking to her window. “Yeah bro, you just need to get a job. It’s been way too long. Have any of them called you back?”
	Funny thing: everyone seems to hate me and my resume, which makes perfect sense. My job experience is just 3 months working on my grandfather’s farm. I tried to fluff it up with phrases like future programmer and optimistic dreamer. I really don’t have much to show.
	“No, not one,” I say. “I guess it’s tough to hire a blank page.”
	She sighs. “Anthony, you aren’t a boring person. We’ve been over this. These employers need to know who you are, not who you’ve worked for.”
	She means live interviews. I’ve asked for several, but always, always, the manager is “currently in a meeting”, or “sick”, or “left early”. I’m afraid Marriot is very wrong. I very nearly ask again if anyone’s quit Denny’s yet, but she would have told me. So, I’m stuck. I’m stuck, and I have no one to blame but myself.
	“Good point. I’ll be sure to include ‘lazy and average’ to my resume”, I say. There is a certain bitterness to my tone, but I’ve never really known how to apologize for that. She does not respond.
	We have a long amount of silence. Normally, this would make me and anyone else tense or uncomfortable, but I guess Marriot’s one of those people that are just fine with some quiet. I can only tell because I’ve known her for so long. Turning back onto Terrace Street, she says quickly, as if just out of a daze, “Oh, can you drop me off at Ridley’s today?”
	I chuckle. “Of course. The boy needs a stern talking-to for letting his car take a day off like that.”
	This wins another one from her. I love making her laugh, I really do. I don’t care how easy she makes it for me.
	The first time Marriot met me, I was walking to school in our 7th grade year. Even back then, she was the kind of person who could just start talking with just about anyone. She approached me in an annoyed, desperate kind of way. “Hello, my name is Marriot, what’s yours,” she said. I recall the shock of conversation during my usual half hour of solitary thoughtlessness. I gave a quick “Anthony, do you need something?”, and it turns out that she just needed a bite or two. Well, that and a boyfriend.
	Passing more of the same house painted in different ways, we finally reach the one Ridley lives in. His parents had made it an ugly kind of dusty blue. We find him still attempting to fix his junk pickup. I’m guessing that someone else saw its nasty, turquoise, matte finish and put it out of its misery.
	“Hey Ridley, I brought something for you,” I yell out to him. He just waves.
	Here, I have an option to drive right up next to him in a I-could-run-you-over-but-I-won’t kind of way, but I have much more important nothings to do today. We park on the curb, and as Marriot reaches for the handle, she takes a deep breath, and turns to me. Time stands still.
“Anthony”, she says, “you deserve a chance to prove yourself. Don’t stop until you get that chance.”
What do I say to that? How does she do that? I feel like I just had my first meal in weeks. I watch as she gets out without a word, as though they would serve only as distractions. She’s always been cool that way. I often wish I could be more like her.
I’m glad I didn’t say anything this time. When she joins Ridley, I find myself making entirely unnecessary eye contact with him. Then I realize that my first parking idea would’ve been nice. I avert my gaze and pull a U-turn that’s just a little too fast.
	Unfortunately, when left with the option of going home or going somewhere else, there really isn’t somewhere else I could be. I try not to make driving home depressing, but I also have to get back into the right mood. I have “The Waste” to finish, after all. Wasted potential, wasted time, wasted space. I wonder how many abstract art pieces out there aren’t self-portraits. How common is this mold that I am fitting?
	I soon find myself home. I know this neighborhood too well. To make up for my rushed departure, I park the car extra carefully. But then I shove the door open and slam it closed, knocking over my bike. Thankfully, it makes hardly a ruckus. I have the right to be angry for nothing, because I have nothing. Searching again for more reasons to continue “The Waste”, I ask the question of who’d want to buy it. Who would want to buy what is essentially a mottled, wordless diary page of someone like me? Looking further, who would buy any art piece that was left unfinished? Ignoring the first question, I feel drive again.
	And with it, a tinge of confidence. I can’t be too sure of myself, so I push myself back down with a “it will still be worthless when you’re done”. Much better, but now I must ignore the fact that I am once again right. Do you see my problem yet?
	Walking in, I’m relieved not to see Mom in the kitchen. Given the amount of sun we have today, I guess she’s gardening again. I head upstairs to find my window still open and pouring light onto my uninspired art piece. Even my room, with laundry built up in piles and a sickened eggshell paint on the walls, is better-looking. I have a thing for color, it seems.
	Sitting back down, I notice the sheet isn’t resting flat on the desk. I guess wind blew it over a pen, but I check. There’s nothing under it but the desk itself. The desk which now has a bump?
	I know it was perfectly flat when I left. There are no burn marks. Was it water damage? But neither has a single dry cloud passed over my house, nor has a single, old cup been left in my room, and I’ve never seen water warp wood in such a striking way anyways. It’s nearly an inch thick. It’s almost bark-like.
	I try to push it down, but it’s as tough as the rest of the table. Maybe it was glued on, so I try to rip it off. No, it’s part of the table. Someone did this, right? Tables don’t just up and revert to bark. It’s awfully unusual. It’s fascinating. I bet Mom would get a kick out of it.
	“Hey Mom”, I yell through my window. I’m still not sure if she’s out there.
	After a pause, I hear, “Yes, Anthony? “
	Good. “I gotta show you something… strange”, I say.
	I see her come into view through the window, taking her gloves off as she goes. She was gardening. I check the rest of the desk to see any other deformities. I find that directly under the warp, the wood bends into itself, just like a contact lens. Exceedingly odd. I’ll bet she’ll think I did it somehow.
	I continue to marvel at the thing. Soon, Mom comes knocking on my door. “So, what did you want to show me?” I instinctively hide the art piece behind me. It’s not for her to see anyway.
	“Mom, look at this”, I say softly, pointing to the ripple on my desk. “I left for a moment and came back to this. Do you have any clue what happened?”
	She looks at it, acutely puzzled. She comes up and rubs it lightly with her finger.
	“I’m not sure”, she responds. “It doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen before.”
	“Me neither”, I say quietly.
	After I blank a good while on what else could be the issue, Mom adds, “Maybe there’s some chemical that does this to wood. It’s not water damage, that’s for sure.”
	I agree. “Yeah, I’ll go look it up.”
	“Okay, tell me what you find”, she says. Then she looks at the hand that’s hiding “The Waste”. “Is there anything else you want to show me?”
	“No”, I say. I lie down on my bed and pull out my phone, my usual sign to her that we’re done talking. Maybe there is chemical that affects wood like this, and maybe I can make my desk go back to normal.
	“Anthony?”
	“Yes, Mom,” I ask, looking up and barely getting the words out before going back to the results page.
	“Before I go,” she says, “I wanted to let you know that the washing machine is broken.”
	Ah, I was going to do laundry today. “That’s unfortunate,” I say. I wonder what happened to it this time, but not enough to ask.
	She continues, “Yes, well I’ve already called to get it fixed. Meanwhile, I was planning to go to a laundromat tomorrow. Will you be okay until then?”
It turns out that wood can be bent using ammonia. What even is ammonia? Ah. I’m not doing that to my desk, that’s disgusting. My case is clearly different from these reference images anyways. Oh, but her question.
	“Yeah, don’t worry about me,” I say. It’s not like I have any plans at all tomorrow.
	“Very well,” Mom replies.
	Turns out that vinegar works too, as well as something called dimethyl sulfoxide, and steam. Maybe I could iron it back down? No, that’s dumb. In any case, the deformity is an inch tall. Who’s ever heard of wood changing like that in less than 20 minutes?
	After another 10 of me searching in vain for an answer, I take a picture of the warp. If I were more outgoing, I’d post it online and ask the world what to do, but I decide sawing it off will solve my problem well enough. I go downstairs to see Mom washing her hands, or more specifically, her finger.
	“Getting ready to garden again?” I ask.
	“No”, she says. “It feels like that wrinkle in your desk left something on my hand. Just trying to wash it out.”
	“What, like tree sap?”
	“No… I’m not sure.”
	Strange. “I touched it too, but my hand feels fine”, I say, heading into the garage.
	Normally, I’m supposed to ask before using something like a hand saw, but actually, I almost never ask to use anything at all. It’s a bother. Dad’s not even home. I find one of the saws hanging on the wall, just asking to be used. I grab the handle and sneak it back upstairs.
	I stare at the blade of the saw for a moment on the way, admiring its teeth. I love using Dad’s tools when I can, but normally everything they’re made for costs money. I am no fool with money. If I want to make something, I can play a video game. I walk into my room and look at my desk for the rut.
	What? It’s not there. Is it an optical trick from the light? No, that’s dumb. I close my window anyways, and then feel around where the warp used to be. There are some cracks in the paint, but that’s it. It’s gone.

Chapter 2:

	I get out of the car and give Anthony a quick knuckle bump. “Thanks for the ride. See you later”, I say. I try not to seem rushed.
	“Anytime”, he says. It’s nice to have someone like him around. As he begins to drive off, I turn around to see Ridley. I guess he wasn’t lying, but I’d like to make sure.
	He sees me coming and puts down what looks like the wrench’s cousin. “Hey, beautiful”, he says, smiling.
	“How long have you been at this”, I ask. If he says any time before I was supposed to be picked up, I’ll know he broke it himself. You see, Ridley is kind of new at working on cars.
	“Just since it refused to help me get you from work, I guess. Originally, I thought the battery was just dead again, but I think there’s a problem with the alternator.”
	Car talk. “Uh-huh”, I say, nodding.
	“Yeah, so I’ve been looking at it, but the surface looks completely fine. I still think it’s the main issue, because after I jumpstarted it the first time, it should have recharged enough to work after that, and it did, but only once. If it is the alternator, it’ll cost a couple hundred bucks to replace, unless I fix it myself, but I can’t do that until I figure out how to take the alternator out. I was watching this YouTube video, and I’ve almost figured out how to remove the wires. It’s not the same model as what I have, but they look pretty much the same, I think. That’s the only hard part, because once I remove the wires, I’ll just need to get the belt and bolts off, and then I can take it out nice and easy.”
	I used to think it was cool how much he could say about car parts and machinery. Even so, I still never fail to get lost in his ramblings. You think that was bad, but I just got here. In any case, I knew one thing, because I was there the last time his truck wouldn’t start.
	“So, if the battery was dead, didn’t you try to jumpstart it again”, I ask.
	“Well, yeah, and it started, but I wanted to find out why. Lost track of time, I guess”, he said with a shrug. So, what I’m hearing is that he could have picked me up, but didn’t. I can’t be mad, really. Ridley’s had tunnel vision since the very beginning. This is only the first time he hasn’t picked me up when he said he would. Thankfully, I knew Anthony would be fine getting me instead. I really wish I could just drive my own car…
	“Oh, I know. You’re a thinker. You had something to figure out. At least you’re trying.” He smiles, and takes off his gloves.
	“Yeah, well I think I need a break anyhow. You hungry? Come on, I’ll warm up some food for you,” he says, leading me in. It’s nice being at the end of his tunnel. Almost makes up for it.
	There’s still a ton left in his fridge from the party last night. Pizza, chips, ice cream, and cake, but not a single thing I want to eat. “What happened to the pasta?”
	“Ah, that? I may have had it for breakfast,” he says, grinning at the ceiling. The dork.
	“You couldn’t have cereal just like everybody else, could you,” I say, a little less jokingly than I’d like to admit. His laugh says he doesn’t notice. Then I realize I don’t have the patience to make food, and I’m in an acute need to relax.
	“Alright, I’ll take the pizza,” I say slightly defeated. I grab a couple slices from the fridge and a paper plate from the pack left on the island and head over to the TV. It’s about time to rewatch a classic. Normally, I’d put more thought into what I’m going to watch, but exhaustion does this funny thing where all the sudden you don’t care what you get. Even if I’ve rewatched it 3 times already. Even if my shift is usually an hour longer. Thank goodness we were overstaffed.
	“Hey, it’s been a long day. Come watch Psych with me,” I say, and then add, “We’re starting at episode 1 again. Is that alright?”
	“Yeah, okay. I can watch an episode or two,” he says into the fridge, grabbing his own slices. He can’t say no, but I would like to make sure his car works soon.
	“Alright, and then after that you can go right back to fixing your Ram.”
	“I like this plan,” he responds, and of course he does. It’s mine. I don’t know why, but boys will do just about anything you want. “Are you thirsty? Coke or water?”
	“Coke,” I say.
	If I really think about it, it’s a big reason why our dynamic works at all. He’s super caring if I direct him to be. It’s just kind of difficult to get his attention when I’m not there. We’re almost at 2 months now, which I’ve learned cannot be taken directly as a good sign, but at least I feel safe about him.
	I love the premise of Psych. It’s built around the idea that lying can work if you can actually back it up. It’s a shortcut to victory. Getting Ridley was a victory, even if my methods were a little twisted. Thankfully, I know Ridley’s not going anywhere, because the way he is will not send him to any dangerous places, and not away from me either. He at least knows to be safe when he’s car-tinkering, and that’s the extent of all his life-threatening activity.
	 As we’re watching the intro to episode 2, I notice Ridley glancing at the time. He begins, “Ah, look at that! It’s almost 5 already! I gotta go feed my plants upstairs.”
	Plants. I’ve never been in his room, but if his only bedroom hobby is raising a bunch of vegetables, I have nothing to worry about. It is curious though.
	“Don’t you mean you’ll water your plants?”
	He responds quickly, “No, no, no, you see, they need a lot of micronutrients. That’s why I need this.” He dives like a bomber and grabs my plate of pizza crusts, snatching them with unusual and comedic precision. It was just a tad startling.
	“What, do you have a composter upstairs as well?”
	“Yes, I do,” he says plainly, running almost vertically to his room.
	Does he really water his plants at 5 every day? I’m not quite sure. It’s just about every day I’ve been here that he’s gone up and left me alone for an improper amount of time. I sometimes wonder if he ever wants me to follow him in, but I don’t think he’s that kind of guy. It’s not hard to say I’m that kind of girl though. If he wanted it. I went into this relationship pretty quickly, and I haven’t really asked too many questions, but somehow Ridley’s perfectly fine with that. It’s in his nature, really. I would go so far as to bet he won’t even kiss me until we double date with my parents or something archaic like that. I don’t know. He’s a strange guy.
	Anthony’s strange too. He’s also immature and awkward and all around a bit of a mess. I suppose I stayed with him for the moments when all of that would melt away, and I’d get to see the real him. I’m not unhappy now though. Ridley is great, if not just slightly straight out of the 1800’s. I’m not really sure where we’re going though. Usually, I have milestones other than eating dinner together. It feels more like we’ve hit a wall he put up on purpose.
	Normally that would mean a guy is nervous or doesn’t really like you. But I know he likes me plenty. He tries to spend as much free time as we have together. On account of how poor he is, we are often confined to leftovers and a show, which may sound depressing, but to me is reliable and safe. I’ve taken us out to eat exactly once, and he wasn’t too happy about me paying for it. He’s never hidden how he felt in the expressions he makes, but he takes it a step further by not denying anything either. 	He makes the same face when I paid for dinner as when I ask to see his plants or his room. I really don’t know what the deal is. It always takes him such at least 10 minutes to water them, and he does it every day without fail. A thing like that can make a person’s mind run wild. I’ve imagined a swathing branch of vines and succulents across a shelf, with little flowers dotting the entire thing, and pots of smaller trees reaching up, mixing with, and holding up that arm of vegetation. It’s ridiculous how much I want to see it, actually. I feel like seeing him in there, too.
	“Hey Ridley?”
	“Yeah?”
	Or maybe I’ll surprise him instead. Oddly, I’m no longer exhausted.
	“Do you want any more pizza?” I ask, confirming that I’m staying downstairs.
	“Oh, no thanks,” he says. “It’s all yours, Mary,” he adds.
	“Okay”, I announce as innocently as I can. As far as he knows, I’m not going anywhere. From how he talks about “watering his plants”, it’s not something he really wants to show me. However, they say that relationships are built on trust, so naturally I have to sneak into his room to get a good look. I realize my shoes are still on, so I leave them by the couch. I can be sneaky and a slob today. He left me at work.
	I start up the stairs slowly. I’m unsure how he’ll take it. I’ve tried getting into his room before, but this maniac keeps it locked like a mailbox on the street, and once I was able to get him to tell me that the only place he keeps the key is in his pocket. I don’t know how his mom just allows that, but in the times that I’ve seen her, I believe I was looking at a bystander. She lets him do precisely as he likes, and has little reason not to. It’s like he won’t make moves on me purely out of principle. He refuses to, like some kind of Boy Scout. I’ve dropped every hint in the book, but each time, I’ve been shot down. He just loves saying “We aren’t there yet, Mary” or “I’m not comfortable enough, Mary” or “try to understand, Mary”.
	Not to say he never gets physical. He mainly just treats kissing like the plague. It’s the one thing I don’t like about him, and I’ve never shied from asking questions, but Ridley’s the kind of person you know you can’t convince of anything.
	I reach the top of the stairs, amazed that none of them creak. Then I hear a slight shuffling from behind Ridley’s bedroom door. Plant watering doesn’t take this long. Plant feeding doesn’t either. I reach for its handle slowly before jumping at another sound from inside. I lean in to the base of the door to better hear what’s going on. I start picking up whispers. To himself? Is someone else in there?
	I know he has a younger sister, Amelia. I also know that she’s currently in a ballet class. His mom’s still at work, too, and, well, I’m out here. Though, he does seem like the type who’d talk to himself. I reach for the handle, now unflinching when he makes more sound. I take the brass in hand and begin to turn.
	It moves about a centimeter, and then makes a small click, and stops. No way. He’s locked it again, with his girlfriend, the only other person in the house, just downstairs. Who does that? What could he possibly be doing that’s so confidential? Why does he feel the need to hide it from me?
I would guess that his room may be super dirty, but that’s unbecoming of him. I’d like to say that one of his foremost hobbies is house cleaning, which explains the usual request that I take my shoes off upon walking in. I guess he forgot to today, or maybe felt bad for forgetting about me.
I jiggle the door handle politely but harsher than before, announcing my presence. All I hear is frantic movement from inside. I ask, “Ridley, it’s me. May I come in?”
More loud, quick footsteps, like he’s preparing the room for me. “Just a minute,” he proclaims matter-of-factly, like I was no surprise at all.
Then I hear what sounds like a slammed door. Given that a bathroom is just behind me, I reckon it’s to his closet. Not a place you’d put a plant at all.
I hear his footsteps get nearer and stop, followed by a quick turn of his door lock. He opens the door slowly, filling the crack with the whole of his body. He seems a lot bigger than before. When his face is shown in full, he asks, “What is it.”
I decide it’s okay to be curious. “I wanted to see your room. Could I come in,” I ask again. He looks down and to the left, as if deep in thought over a yes-or-no question. How hard can it be? I look up into his eyes with intensity, trying for an affirmation.
I ask again, “Please? I’m just curious about the plants, that’s all.”
He doesn’t look up. It seems he’s already made up his mind, but can’t figure out how to tell me no. He makes such a big deal out of whatever’s in there, and for seemingly no reason. So, I’m getting in there, one way or another.
Just as he’s about to speak, I gather strength and promptly shove him and the door aside with all I have. Ridley’s not built, but even though he’s certainly bigger, he didn’t expect this.
I become alert, trying to gather as much information as I can from the few seconds he’ll likely give me. True to form, his room is in pristine condition. There is a window indeed surrounded by plants, with flowers I could not name and little bushes too. There is a row of smaller potted plants on the sill, with two larger ones at the floor on one side. On the other is his bedside table, and next to that, of course, is the bed, and it looks as though he keeps nothing under it. At the foot of the bed is a hope chest, and at the other end of the room is the door to his closet.
“What are you doing”, I hear him say behind me. Instead of answering, I’m looking down at the floor. A few planks of it looks warped, with bumps here and there but clustered more around the closet. Makes me wonder if that door can even open. I walk over and proceed to step on all the perceived bumps, confirming that yes, this floor is not flat at all.
“What’s wrong with your floor,” I ask.
“I don’t know. Marriot, you need to leave,” he says, putting an unfriendly emphasis on his last four words. I feel his eyes piercing the back of my head. I look back towards the window, up at a shelf of fantasy books everyone’s read before. Percy Jackson, Eragon, Harry Potter, the first four of the Ranger’s Apprentice series. It’s like he looked up “how to give your room personality”.
“Seriously, what’s your problem,” I bite back. “It’s just a room. I just wanted to see your oh-so-secret bedroom, that’s all.”
He responds, too quickly, too brashly, “Well, now you have. Now get out.”
Why is he doing this? Really, why? He’s always so kind and caring with his words, but also to-the-point. And here now he is only the latter. What for? I look at the closet door again, and then turn around, not to leave but to look him in the eyes. “Tell me what you’re hiding,” I say.
“Nothing. I hate having people in my room.” He gestures mechanically to the doorway. “Leave now, please,” he says stoically. I’ve always hated harsh-toned manners. Beholding the loveless, icy expression of his face, it is then that I realize he means go home.
I just don’t get it. I don’t get it. Aside from the floor, there is nothing special about this room. No boy has ever even remotely disliked me being in theirs. What a freak. Why has he become so cold? And as for his closet, it doesn’t matter. There could be Playboys or crystal meth or illegal firearms and knives in there, but he can be stashing plastic bags for all I care.
I want to make it clear that I understand where he wants me. “Fine. Goodbye, good-for-nothing.” And with that, I walk out, I walk downstairs, grab my shoes and purse, and leave his good-for-nothing house.
Anthony’s right, it does look just as bad as every other on the outside. Can’t fix that, can he? That jerk. I don’t care what anyone says. No one treats me like that. I don’t care that we were doing so well together, even despite never getting physical. I don’t care that he drives me home from work and feeds me and keeps me company. I don’t care that he knows how to hold me just right during a movie, and that he’ll watch anything with me and make sure I feel okay and comfort me effortlessly when I seem to begin crying for no reason. I don’t get how he doesn’t even need to understand or know why. I love how he only thinks with his head and his heart, and only about how I’m doing, and how he puts himself on the sideline not because he’s less important but because he really doesn’t need help.
Oh. I’m at the end of the block now, shoes still in hand. I just don’t understand. He was not his usual self at all. It’s like I killed his dog or something. I sit down on the sidewalk, sliding my sneakers over my now quite dirty socks. I guess I’ve only known him for seven weeks. At long last, he showed me a side that is cold and unforgiving, one that is coolheaded in a way that seems impossible to keep up and would probably give way to some kind of violence.
But this is Ridley, Mr. Follow-the-rules. The way his mom acts like he’s in charge for a good reason is unlike anything I’ve seen, but is truly backed up well. No, he would never try to hurt me. He didn’t even take a step towards me. Still, I hate how angry he got over nothing. Nothing.
I decide to walk all the way home. It was less a decision and more a process of finishing a recipe. I feel this gnawing pit inside me, screaming for a quiet space where I could let go of myself and collapse. He treated me like an intruder in his house. His own girl. I can’t handle that, I really can’t.
I walk past the road to Anthony’s. I don’t need to see him right now. I don’t need to see any of these people. They’re all so different and odd, and when did I become such a magnet for such people? It wasn’t always this way. I’ve known some amazing people. There’s one in particular, but he’s long gone. He’s gone. I need to stop thinking about them, but now he’s in my head.
No. No, please, I don’t have the strength. I need to get home; I need to get home. I don’t want to think about him. Please, just keep moving your legs. You’re almost there. Just walk over that curb, and keep going. You don’t need to think to move. Don’t think about exes or boys or dating. Don’t think about Lucas, don’t…
Oh, oh no.
No, I remember. Lucas was amazing. He was everything I ever needed in this world. He was so care-free, but made me feel like royalty in a way that made us perfect equals. He was so well put together, and he made so much time for me even despite how busy he was living such an amazing life. Oh, dear Luke, why did you have to leave? Why did you leave me? You did nothing wrong.
No, no, no. I can’t break down here. Windows and eyes are everywhere. Come on, keep walking. I can’t handle that attention. Please, just everyone, leave me alone now. Just let me go home. I hope Mom isn’t there. I just want myself and a sad, little bed with a sad, little pillow to sob into. That’s all, just keep moving.

*	*	*

Did I make it? Is it just coincidence that this surface feels more prickly than soft, that it smells more like dirt and mowing than pillows should? Please tell me I’m not collapsed in a fit on some random’s lawn.
Abort. Get up. Clean up. This isn’t the time. I have to get away from here. I hear a voice from the lawn’s house. I don’t need another pitying “are you alright” from anyone. I stand up fast and fall into a full sprint. Everything is so blurry, but it’s not late or dark enough to matter. I run the whole way home.
I dash through the door, which we’ve always left unlocked, and go straight to my room and into my bed, slamming all doors behind me. I look up briefly at my window, spotless and spotlighting me for the whole town to see. I know my shutters are as broken as they’ve ever been, but I decide to get up and pull them down anyways, severing the string and snapping several of the shutters. No luck at all.
New plan. I grab my blanket and pillow and run into the bathroom, closing and locking the door, not bothering with the light. I throw the cushioning into the bathtub, and throw myself in too. No one will find you here, I tell myself. You have permission to cry.

Chapter 3:

	Well, problem solved right? No more bump on top, and as I feel underneath… no indent below. I could say I just imagined it, but I had to do the smart thing and show it to Mom. But if it really left as soon as it had come… well I just don’t know, do I? I’m not crazy… I should show Mom again.
Quickly, I run out of my room and to the balcony. Looks like she’s in the kitchen again.
	I yell down to her, “Hey Mom?”
	“Yes?”
	“The bump is gone! Come see”, I say.
	 Then she gives me the oddest look. My mother is not easily baffled by things, including strange instances involving dead wood growing, but it going away? Well, it’s enough for anyone to question a lot of things. I’m again considering the thought that this could be an elaborate prank. Perhaps Dad snuck inside and switched out the desk? He is known to be a dabbling carpenter (or at least knows how to cut a 2-by-4), and I have not checked his room for the lookalike.
So quickly, I do. I look around my parents’ bathroom, searching for anything that would resemble my desk. The vanity looks the same as it ever has, and there are no pieces hiding within. Really, that’s such an odd place to keep anything. After the closet, I should really check the garage. I practically jump into their closet, looking for anything besides clothes or shoes. But that’s all I find. I even think to check under their bed, because suppose he just switched out the top, or suppose the legs just came off easy for stowing. I fall to the floor, and crawl under, shoving junk boxes aside like water on a swim, except the way a weak person would do it.
Looking around in there, I find candy wrappers, nasty old hairs, and a screw. I shove aside another box, and behind it--
	“Anthony, are you looking for something?”, I hear her say. Behind that last box is a plank of wood. It looks to be the same color as my desk, too. This could be it.
	I crawl out backwards with the plank in hand, and accidentally hit the back of my head on the bed frame. Right on the center, right where it would hurt most. And it does.
	“Careful, there!”, she says. “Are you okay?”
	“Yes, Mom,” I say, rubbing the new bump on my head that’s still pulsing in pain. It’s not important.
	“Look”, I say, holding up the plank, “this looks like a piece of my desk, like maybe Dad made the whole desk bump himself.”
	It’s only when she begins to speak that I notice a less concerned, more irritated look on her face. “Anthony, that wood is clearly a part of the inner bed frame. And that mess behind you,” she says, pointing to the boxes I moved, “those will be put back immediately.”
	What an idiot. Looking at the plank in the light, I see now that it’s not even the right color. A child could have made this mistake. Defeated, I decide to do a trade-off.
	“Sorry, Mom… while I’m cleaning this up, can you at least give the desk another look?”
	“Alright”, she says, walking towards my room.
	I push in the last of the boxes relatively how they were placed before, and discover where the plank had seemingly unscrewed itself from the rest of the frame. Naturally, the screw I found was a perfect fit, so I put it in by hand as far as I could.
	I was in there for quite a while actually. Messing never takes even half as long as cleaning, does it. But I haven’t heard a thing from Mom yet.
	I have a look into my room. The desk is still there, and still normal again, but I guess Mom left without a sound. From my window, the sun continues to pour light in. It gives my room a somber look, a peaceful look, like a memory that’s only sad because things were so much better then.
	I walk out slowly, and go down the stairs. I was better once. I had promise. I was doing things, thinking that one day they would culminate into skills I could be proud of. Except, at the time, I only did them because it was fun.
	Where does fun go when you grow up? Why does success become more important? And why am I always getting sidetracked? Where is Mom?
	“Hey, where’d you go?” I ask. Promptly, I hear the clink of a dish in the kitchen. “Over here”, she says.
	Walking in, I find her making dinner. Looks like enchiladas, judging by the tortillas, chicken, and other bits I never cared enough to identify before.
	“Well?” I say, “Did you see the desk?”
	“Yes”, she says. “How unusual.” Huh. I thought she’d be more amazed. I guess she’s in food-prep mode, which doesn’t make much sense.
	I look at the time. As it turns out, it is now 4:25, meaning Marriot’s shift did not end at 5. You’d think I would take even a meager interest in the time. I suppose Marriot would, as does Mom. One has a job, while the other seems capable of making 2 meals a day every day at the same 8 and 6 o’ clock. Time tends to be important when one has plans.
	But my plans today did not exist. Gone are the days I can just invite people over. I don’t know anyone anymore, and there’s nothing they’d like to do here anyways. Even to Mother, it seems I just sulk about in my room all the time.
	Suddenly, I’m moved by the thought of having a schedule. Not like a school schedule, where it’s determined for me. One that I choose. Getting a job has been on my mind for a long time, but in all these past months, I’ve only been turned down or ghosted by every company I’ve applied to. For months, I have been a slow-growing failure.
	Well, maybe I’m tired of sulking. I have the right to work. I have the right to be able to be just like everyone else. I don’t care how stuck-up that sounds. This world is cruel to people like me.
	I look at the time again. It is only 4:26 now. It’s not too late to act today. I’m sick of waiting for responses anyhow. I’ve got eighteen applications that have never been answered at all. One in particular sticks out though. I initially wanted to work at the Jimmy’s grocery store because of their 25% discount for employees. I could save Mom a lot of money that way, and additionally, it’s a perfect distance away, and I could even bike if I want to save even more. I don’t care what I’d have to do there. I’ll clean bathrooms. I’ll work the graveyard shift. But I won’t keep waiting for them to answer an application they never looked at.
	I return to my car as if on auto-pilot. I almost hear Mom asking where I’m going, but it’s drowned out by the accidental slamming of the garage door. I’m going to go ask for an interview. I’ll demand it, even. 4:30 is well within store hours, and I think it’s Wednesday, too., so the manager is definitely there. It’s beyond unprofessional that they still haven’t said a word. It’s time to make them look at me. Just like Marriot said, I deserve a chance to prove myself.
	I see Jimmy’s the moment I turn onto West Boulevard. I guess it’s about a mile from our house. Normally, I’d feel really anxious about now, but instead, I’m simply focused. Or I was. It’s possible that I may be turned away again, which would mean yet another failure on my list. I can hear them saying “the manager isn’t here” again. What would Marriot do about that?
	Well, she’s always been great at convincing people. She would control the conversation by asking all the questions. I don’t think my brain runs that fast though. I am always in rehearsal during actual conversations. It’s probably detrimental at this point to plan in advance, especially given that I always do, and it always ends poorly. I need to do what I never do.
	A little planning wouldn’t hurt though. I need them to become unable to say no. Unable to lie, even. Act like I know more than they do. I find myself parking already, so it’s only a matter of a hundred steps from here to there. Let’s see how this goes.
	I’m scanning the store as soon as I’m inside. There are no dinky Walmart-esque vests to look for, but I don’t remember what the employees do wear. I think black, collared shirts? Nametags for sure. Yeah, looks like it. I head to the first… is it called a kiosk? There’s an older lady there, but she’s turned around. She’s also with a customer. Then I see another girl, probably about my age, who isn’t busy. I walk past the other kiosks to her, and prepare to speak.
	No. That’s what I’d normally do. No plan. Just be in the moment. We are here for what rightfully belongs to us.
	She sees me coming, sees me looking at her. I don’t care. “Hello”, I say, “What’s your name?”
	“My name”, she says, using her hands to frame her nametag while smiling patiently, “is Jamie. How can I help you?”
	Jamie works at Jimmy’s. I don’t know how to read. It probably looks like I’m interested in her, given how many employees I walked past. Best to leave these thoughts alone.
	“I’m wanted to have a talk with the manager. I’d like to work here, you see”, I say.
	“Oh, okay”, she stutters. She’s nervous? Then she says, “Um, I don’t think the manager’s here right now.” Oh. She’s lying. I try to hide this realization from showing up on my face. I think it works. I think I can lie too.
	“Oh, that’s odd. I saw them come in not ten minutes ago. Could you please take me to their office?”, I say.
	It feels really good when she says “Oh, okay” again and motions me to follow her. If ever you could win a 10-second conversation, I just did. It helps that she’s just as anxious as I’d normally be. We head to a door by the bathrooms right next to us, and for a moment I feel unprepared. Unbeknownst to her, this is my first time actually meeting the manager, but I just need to remember that I’m only here for what’s owed to me. I am owed this chance.
	Jamie asks me to wait outside and disappears behind the door. Except for the little stick-people that often go on bathroom doors, this one looks exactly the same. I suppose uniformity is good in a place like this. Even if a passing drunk wanders into the wrong room because of it. And makes a mess of the beloved paperwork. Oh, the thoughts I have.
	I end up waiting a lot longer than anyone would be comfortable with. I generally think of people in power as a little scary, but maybe this one’s just shy. Or incredibly busy. I end up leaning against the wall, nearest the handle end of the office door. I’m not just gonna stand there like I want attention. Everyone who I need it from is behind this very soundproof door.
	I begin to consider going in uninvited, but perhaps that would strike me with a subordinate light. Obedience makes a much better impression. And patience, I guess. I throw my eyes about, looking lost but not looking at any of the many customers that were definitely giving me questioning glances. Why on earth do grocery stores have to be so tall?
	Suddenly, the office door swings open. I jump a little, to which an equally surprised Jamie makes a small screech more resembling a peep. “Ah, you scared me!” she says, without even a trace of a smile on her face. Maybe their talk didn’t go too well.
	I begin to apologize when she then says, “Anyways, Mr. Harding is waiting inside”. She holds the door politely behind her, which still gives me hardly enough space to walk through.
	I am met with an unusually tidy little office housing a very plain-looking Mr. Harding. He’s a little overweight, and probably about 45, but retains a full head of hair. His uniform does not seem to fit very well, as though he used to be much, much larger. His nametag simply reads: “Ben”.
	How to begin this conversation… calling him Mr. Harding would be professional, but conventional. Calling him Ben would present me as more personable, but maybe less respectful. Risk here, risk everywhere. But I’m just here for what’s owed.
	“Mr. Harding, how are you?” I say, smiling like I mean it, reaching for a handshake.
	He smiles, and I instantly regret it. I didn’t know people still chewed tobacco, and I got the sight and smell of it rather quickly. Here’s to the price of social niceties.
	“Yes, hello. And what is your name?” he asks me.
	Just a name won’t do. This conversation needs to move, and I need to be in control. “Anthony. I’m here to see if this place is right for me.”
In theory, that puts him into questioning, and moves along the assumption that I’ll probably get hired. He squints a little bit, as if aware that he’s lost power but not sure as to how.
“Ah… well!” he says, “We’re glad to look into it. Let’s see what we can do.” That’s a lot of royal we’s. He turns around and opens a cabinet, and then pulls out a binder. He opens to the first sheet, and I see what looks like names of people and of weekdays. He still has an opening, right? What if there isn’t one? He’s flipping the page; more names and weekdays.
No, I can’t stress out like this. I always do that. It’s never helped. So, what can I do? Well, patience is good, but maybe I can push my control a little further.
“I imagine you’ve gotten a lot of other applications, haven’t you”, I say. “What did you think of mine?”. If he hasn’t, this places him further down. If he’s professional enough to tell, that is.
He stops, and looks over his shoulder slightly. “You’re right, we do have a lot of applications”, he says. I jump in, “So it must be really busy here then, huh?”. If so, I could point to myself as the solution. Please be busy. He dodged my second question. Maybe I should only ask one at a time…
“Yeah, yeah, it has been. It often is this time of year”, he says thoughtfully, turning back to me. “So, what kind of experience do you have?”
Experience. Did he read my resume after all? Agh, how do I phrase this in a non-detrimental way? Control, I need control.
“Well, sir, of everything I have, job experience is lacking. Everyone needs a first job though.” He can’t argue with that. It’s not like they design airships here.
He doesn’t respond for a bit, so then I ask, “What was your first job, Mr. Harding?”
He squints again at me, and then looks up, like his memory bubble is right there on the ceiling tiles. “Funny you should ask that”, he says, followed by a long hmm.
“For my first job, I worked at a Blockbuster, renting out DVD’s and such.”
“Did they ask about experience?” Come on, come on…
“No, they didn’t. Matter of fact, they didn’t even ask for a resume. I just came in, asked for the job, and began working that same day.”
Bingo. Now I am your equal. Let’s keep the ball rolling.
“I’ll bet you were a great employee. So, what is it you’re looking for in new hires?”
He looks perplexed. I suppose he’s used to asking all the questions.
“Well, let’s see. Mainly, we want people who are reliable and good with customers.” He chuckles. “I guess seeing that they have experience is a lot easier than figuring that out myself.”
“I see. Yeah, those two aspects are really important. I recognize that every new hire is a risk, but I don’t need experience to let you know I’m reliable. I’ve been searching for a good first job for a long time, and working here would be perfect for me.” Okay, let’s get more vulnerable. “No one else has even given me the chance. I know I’m a hard worker, but no one else would listen.”
I’m throwing everything at this guy. Be the one to lift me up. I’m just like you were once. I initiated this interview and I’m what you’re looking for and I’ve been honest with you. Clearly, I’m a good kid. This is what I deserve.
“So, do you have any questions for me?” I ask. He looks down at his paper. I guess it shows the shifts everyone here works.
And then, he closes the binder. “I’m sorry”, he says. “We aren’t hiring right now.”
What? What?
“Are you sure? I don’t need extensive hours. I’ll take whatever you have. Can’t you fit me in?”
“I’m afraid Jamie already filled the last of it.”
…
“Maybe try coming back in a month or two. We’d love to have you.”
His disgusting teeth show themselves again in mock apology. You liar, you filthy liar.
