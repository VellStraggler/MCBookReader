# Minecraft Book Reader
## In-game Settings:
- Resolution: 1600x900@60 (24 bit)
- GUI Scale: 3
- Set to Fullscreen
- Render Distance: 2
- Mouse Sensitivity: uncertain
- Default controls
## Computer Settings:
- Make sure Fn Lock is on. You can test this by pressing the volume button.
It should not change the volume. You can turn on Fn Lock by pressing Fn + esc
- Make sure it is not on battery saver mode, or the GPU will not be used by
Minecraft.
## Fixes required:
- Change the F3Data to read ALL components, then sort through for the favorites
  - The locations of the important components should be stored during initialization
  - Then, F3Data will only read the important components
## Ideas not yet implemented:
- movement
- turning
- decision-making
- any actions at all
- retrieving items from known locations
- path-finding
## Ideas that are out of scope:
- Diagonal movement
- Use of vehicles
